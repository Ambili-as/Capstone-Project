# **Student's Performance and Learning style Analyis**

**Name** : Ambili A S
**Organisation** : Entri Elevate

**Overview** :
  Education plays a vital role in determining students' future opportunities, and identifying the factors that impact academic achievement can support the development of more effective teaching methods. This project focuses on analyzing student performance data along with their learning styles to build a regression model that predicts exam scores. By applying data science techniques, the goal is to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships that can help educators, students, and policymakers make data-driven decisions to enhance educational outcomes and support personalized learning.

  ## **Objectives**
*   To explore the relationship between learning styles and student performance.
*   To identify key features that influence Exam score.
*   To develop and evaluate the best machine learning model for predicting students' Exam score.
*   To provide insights that can help optimize teaching methodologies based on student learning behaviors.
